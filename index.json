    "keywords": "Intro There are multiple APIs for itch.io, depending on your use case, you might want to use one or multiple at the same time. All the APIs are listed in the sidebar, some have their own quirks, to read about them, click on the API name. All the JSON APIs have a quirk caused by the library that was used to serialize objects by the server. Where normally you'd find an empty array [ ] , the library will return an empty object { } . This quirk still exists for backwards compatibility reasons, it might not exist in newer versions of the API. See itch.io#1301 and go-itchio@b3ae624 Glossary Endpoints A base URL is the url that needs to be prepended to the method path, you can find it in the main page for the API you want to use, if not specified, use https://itch.io . Parts of the URL in {name} format are URL parameters, they are replced with the value of the parameter, including the {} , e.g. /games/{gameId}/ => /games/5318008/ . All other parameters are query parameters, following HTTP standards. The HTTP method for requests is defined in the endpoint page header. Types If a class extends another class, it has all the properties of the parent, plus ones defined bellow. Arrays types have [] appended to the base type, e.g. string[] is an array of string . Numeric types have their bitness appended to them, e.g. int32 is a 32 bit integer. DateTime represents a struct containing a date and time. Base response Most APIs here will return the following JSON object on a non 2xx error code: Field Type Description errors string[] List of errors that have occured. If not set, no errors details string A more detailed error."

    "keywords": "RSS API Official documentation: https://itch.io/updates/rss-feeds-for-browsing-games This API has an ugly brother, a Web API equivalent, please use this API instead This API lets you retrieve lists of popular and new games from itch. The URL for this feed can be retrieved by going to https://itch.io/games , selecting your desired filters and appending .xml to the URL, e.g. https://itch.io/games/top-sellers/free/platform-linux.xml . This method however is not recommended, because the website will not allow you to select some filters at the same time. You can paginate these feeds by using the page query parameter, e.g. https://itch.io/games/top-sellers/free/platform-linux.xml?page=2 will return the second page of results. The feed will always return 30 games per page, if it returns less or none, this means you've reached the end of this feed. If you wish to generate the URL programatically, you should order the filters in a specific order, as URLS with incorrectly ordered filters will redirect you to a URL with correct filters (), but any or all query parameters will be lost ( itch.io#1299 ) Returns Note: This is a XML document, the following is the contents of the <channel> element.

If using API keys, replace the {key} in the base URL with the API key or key and set the Authorization request header to Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY} .
