# itch.io API community documentation  
This website is dedicated to documentating the itch.io API, as it doesn't have a full documentation yet.  
This is not an official documentation, everything is based on partial official documentation provided by itch and community findings.  

[The API is not fully standardized yet](https://itch.io/post/329261) and [there isn't enough users](https://itch.io/post/443251) to warrant a full documentation.
